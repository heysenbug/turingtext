# Turing Text

This is a simple receipt parser that takes an image of a reciept and turns it into useful data

## Installation

Turing Text has been tested with python 3.12. Recommended approach is to install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) on your system, and use [venv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Turing Text accepts an optional source directory parameter. If one isn't provided then it will look for the `unorganized` directory
